### Summary

A fidget spinner with a satisfying divot shape around each weight.

Three files are available to download:

- Fidget Spinner
- Fidget Spinner Handles
- Fidget Spinner without holes

### Print Settings

- Print without supports.
- The handle STL file has a helper disk in between the M and F parts to improve bed adhesion.

### Bill of Materials

- Four 608 skateboard bearings
- Permanent adhesive

### Assembly

*Note: Assembly is optional. Parts may join without glue; or only without glue depending on the dimensional accuracy of the print.*

- **Assembling the Main Body**
	- Coat the outside circumference of each bearing with glue, and slide each bearing into one of the four holes on the main body.

- **Assembling the Handle**
	- Insert the F side handle into the center bearing, and apply glue into the center hole.
	- Insert the M side handle into the center bearing, using the hexagonal peg to orient the part.
	- Please refrain from spinning the toy until the glue is fully dry.

### Optional

- You may be able to replace the bearings used as weights with something different, so I've included a blank fidget spinner 3MF file with negative volume cylinders located in the correct positions.
	- You can also use this file to fine-tune the bearing hole diameters.
